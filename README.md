Simply, in 2016, we got around 12th in the northwest part of China.
The problem is an NP hard problem, and it's named as TSP with some constrains.
We use the dynamic programming to solve it, although the global optimization is not depended on the local optimization totally. However, 
the difference between the best answer and the second better answer is not that important.
For some complex data, we add an inverse dp method to it. Finally, we combine the two consequnces of the dp arrays. In some difficult 
senarios we deal them better than other ways.
Anyway thanks to my teammates.

In 2017, also, I try to use dp method. But it does not perform well. After a few days, my team work out to use the guideline of 
Simulated annealing (SA) , with the combination of dp and minimum cost maximum flow by zkw and symmetric(duiouï¼‰.
